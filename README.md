# Mhealthy
Mhealthy is a mental health webapp that aims to support individuals in tracking and improving their emotional well-being. 🌟

One of the key design patterns I implemented in the app is the Interpreter pattern, which allows the app to interpret the user's daily mood and provide personalized insights and recommendations. By analyzing the user's mood expressions, the app can offer tailored suggestions for self-care activities, meditation exercises, or even connecting with friends and loved ones. 🎯

Additionally, I incorporated the Observer pattern to ensure the safety and well-being of users. The app allows users to add emergency contacts, and in case of a distressing mood, the app automatically notifies the designated contacts by sending SMS using twilio sms api 🆘

Here is a demonstrative video :
